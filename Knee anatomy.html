    <h2>Bony Structures:</h2>
    <p>The knee joint is a complex synovial hinge joint formed by the articulation of the femur, tibia, and patella. The femoral condyles articulate with the tibial plateau, forming the main components of the knee joint.<br>
        The patella, embedded within the quadriceps tendon, aids in knee extension and provides a mechanical advantage during movements.</p>

    <h2>Ligaments:</h2>
    <p>Collateral ligaments, including the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and the lateral collateral ligament (LCL), provide crucial medial and lateral stability to the knee joint.<br>
        Cruciate ligaments, the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), control anterior-posterior translation and rotational stability within the knee.<br>
        Additional ligaments, such as the transverse ligament and the oblique popliteal ligament, contribute to the overall stability of the knee joint.</p>

    <h2>Menisci:</h2>
    <p>The medial and lateral menisci are critical fibrocartilaginous structures that provide shock absorption, load transmission, and joint stability within the knee.<br>
        These crescent-shaped structures adapt to the articulating surfaces of the femur and tibia, enhancing joint congruence and distributing mechanical forces during weight-bearing activities.</p>

    <h2>Muscles:</h2>
    <p>The quadriceps femoris, comprising the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and vastus intermedius, is essential for knee extension and stability.<br>
        The hamstring muscle group, including the biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus, plays a pivotal role in knee flexion and rotational control.</p>

    <h2>Tendons:</h2>
    <p>The quadriceps tendon, an extension of the quadriceps muscles, inserts onto the patella, continuing as the patellar tendon, which attaches to the tibial tuberosity, contributing to knee extension and stability.</p>

    <h2>Physiology of the Knee:</h2>

    <h3>Kinematics and Biomechanics:</h3>
    <p>The knee joint's complex biomechanics allow for smooth and controlled movements, integrating flexion, extension, internal and external rotation, and slight lateral and medial gliding.<br>
        Synovial fluid reduces friction between articular surfaces, ensuring smooth joint motion during various activities.</p>

    <h3>Load Distribution and Transmission:</h3>
    <p>Weight-bearing activities transmit significant forces through the knee joint. The articular surfaces, menisci, and surrounding structures work harmoniously to distribute loads and minimize stress concentrations, protecting the joint from excessive wear and tear.</p>

    <h3>Neuromuscular Control and Stability:</h3>
    <p>Neuromuscular coordination is vital for maintaining knee joint stability and preventing injury. Muscular co-contractions and proprioceptive feedback mechanisms play crucial roles in maintaining joint integrity during dynamic movements and weight-bearing tasks.</p>

    <h3>Innervation and Vascular Supply:</h3>
    <p>The knee joint receives sensory innervation from various nerves, including branches of the femoral, obturator, sciatic, and tibial nerves, which contribute to proprioception and pain perception.<br>
        Vascular supply to the knee joint is provided by branches of the popliteal artery, ensuring adequate oxygenation and nutrient delivery to the joint structures.</p>
